Amelia Lite was built with newest Enterprise-level of technology both on front-end and back-end, ensuring smooth and slick user experience. Amelia elements are applying single-page-app approach, work without page reloading, and all elements were designed with the mobile first concept in mind - so all the admin and customer interfaces are perfectly responsive.

Amelia Lite supports:

* Creating Step-by-step booking view by adding [ameliabooking] shortcode
* Configuring the general settings for the company - [General Settings](https://wpamelia.com/general-settings/)
* A convenient Calendar view on the back-end, giving a full overview on all the appointments and the statuses - [Calendar Admin View](https://wpamelia.com/admin-calendar/)
* Flexible Appointment Management page, with an option to add appointments by your staff from the WordPress admin dashboard - [Appointments Admin Page](https://wpamelia.com/admin-appointments/)
* Configuring provider's details and working schedule - [General Settings](https://wpamelia.com/general-settings/)
* Key numbers in the Dashboard - [Dashboard page](https://wpamelia.com/admin-dashboard/)
* Email notifications to the customer and provider when the appointment status changes.

Configuring Amelia Lite to book your first appointment through WordPress is literally a 5-minute job.

* First, you would need to go to your WordPress' admin page, open Amelia -> Services and add categories and services, as described [here](https://wpamelia.com/services-and-categories/).
* On the next step, you would need to add a step-by-step booking wizard to one of your posts or pages. To do that, just create a new post or page, or edit an exiting one, and add [ameliabooking] shortcode where you want to add the booking wizard. Save it - and that's it - now customers can book appointments from your site's front-end using Amelia Lite!
* You can customize provider details and schedule in the [General Settings](https://wpamelia.com/general-settings/) page.
